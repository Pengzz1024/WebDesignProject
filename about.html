                <p> The Little Prince (French: Le Petit Prince), 
                    first published in April 1943, is a novella, the most famous work of French aristocrat, 
                    writer, poet, and pioneering aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.</p>
                <p>The novella has been voted the best book of the 20th century in France. 
                    Translated into 300 languages and dialects, selling nearly two million copies 
                    annually, and with year-to-date sales of over 140 million copies worldwide, it has become 
                    one of the best-selling and most translated books ever published</p>
                <p>After the outbreak of the Second World War, Saint-Exupéry escaped to North America.
                     Despite personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for 
                     which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss, 
                     in the form of a young prince visiting Earth. An earlier memoir by the author had recounted
                      his aviation experiences in the Sahara Desert, and he is thought to have drawn on those same 
                      experiences in The Little Prince.</p>
                <p>Since its first publication, the novella has been adapted to numerous art forms and media, including
                     audio recordings, radio plays, live stage, film, television, ballet, and opera.</p>
                <p>Though ostensibly styled as a children's book, The Little Prince makes several observations about life
                     and human nature.</p>

                    <p>Antoine Marie Jean-Baptiste Roger, comte de Saint-Exupéry 29 June 1900 
                        – 31 July 1944) was a French writer, poet, aristocrat, journalist, and pioneering aviator. He became
                         a laureate of several of France's highest literary awards and also won the U.S. National Book Award. He 
                         is best remembered for his novella <em>The Little Prince (Le Petit Prince)</em>> and for his lyrical aviation 
                         writings, including Wind, Sand and Stars and Night Flight.
                        </p>
                    
                    <p>Saint-Exupéry was a successful commercial pilot before World War II, working airmail routes in Europe,
                         Africa and South America. At the outbreak of war, he joined the French Air Force (Armée de l'Air), flying 
                         reconnaissance missions until France's armistice with Germany in 1940. After being demobilised from the French 
                         Air Force, he travelled to the United States to help persuade its government to enter the war against Nazi Germany.
                          Following a 27-month hiatus in North America, during which he wrote three of his most important works, he joined 
                          the Free French Air Force in North Africa, although he was far past the maximum age for such pilots and in 
                          declining health. He disappeared over the Mediterranean on a reconnaissance mission in July 1944, and is 
                          believed to have died at that time.
                        </p>
    
                    <p>Prior to the war, Saint-Exupéry had achieved fame in France as an aviator. His literary works – among them The Little Prince,
                         translated into 300 languages and dialects – posthumously boosted his stature to national hero status in France. He earned 
                         further widespread recognition with international translations of his other works. His 1939 philosophical memoir Terre des 
                         hommes (titled Wind, Sand and Stars in English) became the name of an international humanitarian group, and was also used 
                         to create the central theme of the most successful world's fair of the 20th century, Expo 67 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

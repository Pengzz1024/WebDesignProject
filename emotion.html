                or abilties. An arrogant person will always think in his own way, he will put 
                himself at the first position and therefore he couldn't find out others' merit.</p>

            <p>In general, if you find a person who is arrogant, you should be known that he will easily
                complain others, you don't have to feel upset if you are treated bad by those people,
            it's their fault.

            <h2>Vanity<h2>

            <p>Vanity represented by the conceited man, the little prince met him at the second planet</p>

            <p>Vanity means excessive pride in or admiration of one's own appearance or achievements.
               A vain person likes exaggerate his achievements, moreover he will even lie a lot to pretend
               himeself is great. Those people are crazy about others' praise and admiration, they live in a 
               fictitious dream which created by themself.</p>

            <p>If you know a person who is vain, don't pay attention to arguing with them about whether 
            their achievement is real or fake. They will never wake up from their virtul dream. You just 
            need to give them a smile and keep in silence, they won't bother you</p>

            <h2>Sadness<h2>

            <p>Sadness represented by the tippler, the little prince met him at the third planet</p>
            
            <p>Sadness means the condition or quality of being sad. It's not exclusive for adults,
                children could sometimes have sadness too. But children won't be sad for a long time, the 
                adults do the opposite things.
            </p>

            <p>If you have a friend who set himself in sadness for a long time, you should be patient with 
                them and try to accompany with them. Though a sad person will be indifferent to others, he 
                need help. He wants to stay alone because he feels lonely and helpless. A friend should bring
                him back from sorrow.

        <section class="c-blind">
            <h2>Blind<h2>

            <p>Blind represented by the businessman, the little prince met him at the fourth planet</p>

            <p>Blind means lacking perception, awareness, or judgement rather than physical sight. A blind
               person don't possess the ablity of thinking. They will do things like others, they will think
               as others. In the most of time, they don't figure out the reason why he should do a thing, they 
               just waste their energy and time and achieve nothing.
            </p>

            <p>You don't have to take care of your blind friends, because they don't have their own idea, they will
                rely on you, which is actually bad for them.Sometimes they will get stucked by some wrong ideas,
                but they won't mentioned that, you could give them an advice if it's necessary.

            <h2>Stubbornness<h2>

            <p>Stubbornness represented by the lamplighter, the little prince met him at the first planet</p>

            <p>Stubbornness means having or showing dogged determination not to change one's attitude or
                position on something, especially in spite of good arguments or reaons to do so. A stubborn
                person will be crazy about his own thought and it will be very hard to change him. They don't
                care whether the thing is right or wrong, they just believed and insisted on it.
            </p>

            <p>Don't bother yourself to arguing your stubborn friend, which might bring out a quarrel. All you
                need to do is waiting for a time when he figured our himself was wrong. A rock could only be 
                moved slowly, isn't it?

            <h2>Love<h2>

            <p>Love represented by the rose and fox, one from the litte prince's home, one from the earth</p>

            <p>Love couldn't be defined. Love could be many different form. But in little prince, it could simply
                means a strong feeling of affection for someone.
            </p>

            <p>The rose has love for the little prince. But her love is obscure and she is always ask for
                attention from the little prince.
            </p>

            <p>The fox has love for the little prince too. But her love is to be accutomed to a person
                and accompany him.
            </p>

            <p>There isn't a correct answer to define love. You have to figure it out by yourself :) .</p>

            <p>It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so 
                many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by 
                chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me. </p>

            <p>The first time he saw my 
                    airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated
                     for me), he asked me: "What is that object?" "That is not an object. It flies. It is an 
                     airplane. It is my airplane." And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly. He 
                     cried out, then: "What! You dropped down from the sky?" "Yes," I answered, modestly. "Oh! 
                    That is funny!" "That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that 
                    you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to." </p>
            
                    <p>But the little prince seemed 
                            shocked by this offer: "Tie him! What a queer idea!" "But if you don't tie him," I said, 
                            "he will wander off somewhere, and get lost." My friend broke into another peal of laughter: 
                            "But where do you think he would go?" "Anywhere. Straight ahead of him." Then the little 
                            prince said, earnestly: "That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!" And,
                             with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: "Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far . . ."</p>
        
              
            <p>I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little 
                prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house! But that did not really surprise me
                 much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets—such as the Earth, Jupiter, 
                 Mars, Venus—to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which
                are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer
                discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for
                example, "Asteroid 325." I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the 
                little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612. </p>

           
            <p>This asteroid has only once been seen through
                    the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909. On making his discovery, the astronomer
                    had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he
                    was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said. Grown-ups are like that. . .
                    Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law 
                    that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the 
                    astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. 
                    And this time everybody accepted his report.If I have told you these details about the 
                    asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their 
                    ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions 
                    about essential matters. They never say to you, "What does his voice sound like? What games 
                    does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?" Instead, they demand: "How old is he? How 
                    many brothers has he</p>

            
            <p>How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?" Only from these figures do they 
               think they have learned anything about him.If you were to say to the grown-ups: "I saw a beautiful
               house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof," they would not 
               be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: "I saw a house that
               cost $20,000." Then they would exclaim: "Oh, what a pretty house that is!" Just so, you might 
               say to them: "The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed,
               and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists."
               And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you 
               like a child. But if you said to them: "The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612," then they
               would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.They are like that. One must
               not hold it against them. Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people.
               But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I should have 
               liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should have like to say: "Once 
               upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than 
               himself, and who had need of a sheep ..." To those who understand life, that would have given
                a much greater air of truth to my story.</p>

            <h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/stars.png" alt="second chapter title bg" height="400px">
            </figure>

            <p>For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting
                 down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his 
                 sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget
                  a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the 
                  grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures . . .</p>

            <p>It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard 
                to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa
                 constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall
                  certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of 
                  success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject. I 
                  make some errors, too, in the little prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another
                   too short. And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I fumble along as best I 
                   can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.</p>

            <p>In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not
                 be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like 
                 himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a 
                 little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old. </p>

            <p>As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his 
                departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall 
                from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of 
                the baobabs. This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. </p>

            <p>For the little prince asked  me abruptly—as if seized by a grave doubt—"It is true, isn't it, that
                 sheep eat little bushes?" "Yes, that is true." "Ah! Iam glad!" I did not understand why it was 
                 so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added: "Then it follows 
                 that they also eat baobabs?" I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little 
                 bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of
                 elephants away with him, the herd would 
                    not eat up one single baobab.</p>
                
            <p>The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh. "We would have to put them one on top
                 of the other," he said. But he made a wise comment: "Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out 
                 by being little." "That is strictly correct," I said. "But why do you want the sheep to eat the 
                 little baobabs?" He answered me at once, "Oh, come, come!", as if he were speaking of something that
                  was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any 
                  assistance.</p>

            <h2>CHAPTER 3</h2>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/theprince.png" alt="third chapter title bg" height="400px">
            </figure>

            <p>Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived—as on all 
                planets—good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, 
                and bad seeds from bad plants. </p>
            <p>But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the
                 earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this 
                 little seed will stretch itself and begin—timidly at first—to push a charming little sprig 
                 inoffensively upward toward the sun. If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a 
                 rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one 
                 must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.</p>

            <p>Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and 
                these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab 
                is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It 
                spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet
                 is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces . . .</p>

            <p>"It is a question of discipline," the little prince said to me later on. "When you've finished 
                your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just 
                so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, 
                at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble
                 so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work," the little prince added, "but 
                 very easy." And one day he said to me: "You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the 
                 children where you live can see exactly how all this is. </p>

            <p>That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes," he added, "there
                 is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter of 
                 baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. 
                 He neglected three little bushes ..."</p>

            <p>So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not 
                much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, 
                and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for 
                once I am breaking through my reserve. "Children," I say plainly, "watch out for the baobabs!"</p>

            <p>My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; 
                and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on
                by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me. Perhaps you will ask me, "Why are there 
                no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?"</p>

            <h2>CHAPTER 4</h2>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/princestar.png" alt="fourth chapter title bg" height="400px">
            </figure>

            <p>The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been 
                successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond
                 myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.</p>

            <p>Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your 
                sad little life . . . For a long time you had found your only entertainment
                in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail
                on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me: "I am very fond of 
                sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."</p>
            
            <p>"But we must wait," I said. "Wait? For what?" "For the sunset. We must wait 
                until it is time." At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then
                you laughed to yourself. You said to me: "I am always thinking that I am at home!"
                Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is
                setting over France. If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go 
                straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away
                for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move
                your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever
                you like . . . "One day," you said to me, "I saw the sunset forty-four times!"
                And a little later you added: "You know-one loves the sunset, when one is so sad . . ."
                "Were you so sad, then?" I asked, "on the day of the forty-four sunsets?" But the 
                little prince made no reply.</p>

            <p>On the fifth day-again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep-the secret of 
               the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead 
               up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on 
               his problem, he demanded: "A sheep—if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, 
               too?" "A sheep," I answered, "eats anything it finds in its reach." "Even flowers 
               that have thorns?" "Yes, even flowers that have thorns." "Then the thorns—what 
               use are they?" I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a 
               bolt that had got stuck in my engine</p>

            <p> I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me  that the breakdown of 
                my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I 
                had to fear for the worst. "The thorns—what use are they?"</p>

            <p>The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me,
